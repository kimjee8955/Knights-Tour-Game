# Knights-Tour-Game
Using Tkinter and classes in Python to implement a Knight's Tour Game

This game is an implementation of Knight's Tour problem.

You have to produce the longest possible sequence of moves of a chess knight, while visiting squares on the board only once. This sequence is called "tour". If your tour visits every square, then you have achieved a full tour. If you have achieved a full tour and from your last position you could move to your initial square, then you have achieved a closed full tour.
